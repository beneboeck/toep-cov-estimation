# Gohberg-Semencul Estimation of Toeplitz Structured Covariance Matrices and Their Inverses

Welcome to the (preliminary) repository for the paper "Gohberg-Semencul Estimation of Toeplitz Structured Covariance Matrices and Their Inverses"! This repository contains the code to reproduce the main results of our research work. As the paper is still undergoing the review process, the code, as well as the paper, may change continuously.

## Abstract

In our work, we introduce a class of Toeplitz Covariance Matrix Estimators and their inverses based on the so-called Gohberg-Semencul decomposition, which is closely related to autoregressive parameters.

## Usage

Currently, only the projected least squares estimator (denoted as PLS in our work) is available.
